          <h1>The Man with multiple faces</h1>
          <p>
            One of the most complex paintings you can find around, it is the
            painting of a man but when it gets to the part of his face, <br />
            instead of features its just a mix of colors which determine the
            barrage of emotions he is feeling all at once. <br />
